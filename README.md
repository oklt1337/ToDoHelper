# ToDoHelper
TODO-Helper is a wpf tool that scans C# projects for todo's in the code and creates a list of tasks.
The tasks contain a title, a due date, an asignee, a priority and a description.
Tasks can be moved from the todo state to the in progress or done state by drag and drop.
The tasks are saved via json and automatically reloaded at the next start.
